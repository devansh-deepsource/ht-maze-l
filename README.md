#HTM-HELL README.md


# HTM-HELL is a website that serves as a multiple-level fun game.

The way this works is that each page represents a level. Upon completening the level
you will move on the next and so on. In most of the levels, if you lose, you will be sent
back to the previous page and sometimes even a few pages behind. 

# Level's solutions:
_Level 1_ is a simple button selection game. The text reads "Press the Green OR Blue Button"
therefore any button of the colour blue or green is the correct one. The "Press this button to begin:"
text is meant to confuse the player. If pressed, a new page will show saying that they failed, but
they can try again.

_Level 2_ requires patience. When tried to be clicked, the "Click Me" button will change it's
position and will not be clickable. You have to "Be patient" and wait a few seconds until the text
turns yellow and then a few more seconds until it is green and clickable. If pressed when yellow or red,
the player will be redirected to the previous page.

_Level 3_ has different buttons hidden in the page, each of them displaying an alert. One of the buttons,
positioned in the bottom of scree (middle side) will display a clown image meant to scare the player
and text so they can move to the next level. One of the buttons also sends the player to the previous
page if pressed.

_Level 4_ displays two die that can be rolled when the button is pressed. If the sum of the values shown
is under 8, the player will be redirected to the previous page (to the annoying clown sound to be more
specific). It is all about luck, so it may take a few tries to move on to the next level.

_Level 5_ has a total of 5 ciricle elements which are draggable. The player is asked to input the number
of circles they see, but the immediate answer (3) is wrong. Under the first two circles, there are two 
more circles underneath. Every circle has a border which is a circle itself,so therefore the solution 10. 

_Level 6_ is a love calculator that displays random percents and funnt (we like to think so) quotes, but the
solution is actually displayed as a header: "Love" + "Calculator". Those are the two inputs that need to be
entered in order to pass and move forward.

_Level 7_ is asking the player to select from 4 option, the number of "3" they think are displayed on the
screen. Besides the obvious one (which are four), the first answer option is itself a "3" and also the name of 
the title of the webpage contains two "3"s, therefore the correct answer 7.

_Level 8_ is asking the player to click the word "Here" 16 times. While the multiple "Here" buttons that are
moving left and right on the screen may seem hard to catch and appealing, they do not actually do anything. 
The way the level can be passes is by clicking the actual word "Here" written at the top.

_Level 9_ generates a random number from 1 to 10 in the background and the player is asked to guess which
number it is. When a number is introduced, it is compared to the actual value that needs to be enteres and
informs the player if they shoul input something lower or greater. The level also displays a counter so that
the player know how long it took for them to guess (it feels more satisfying when you get it from the first
try).
